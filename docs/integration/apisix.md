Casdoor can use the OIDC protocol to link to APISIX, and this document will show you how to do it.

The following are some of the names in the configuration:

`CASDOOR_HOSTNAME`: Domain name or IP where Casdoor server is deployed.

`APISIX_HOSTNAME`: Domain name or IP where APISIX is deployed.

## Step1. Deploy Casdoor and APISIX
Firstly, the [Casdoor](https://casdoor.org/docs/basic/installation) and [APISIX](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/how-to-build/) should be deployed. 

After a successful deployment, you need to ensure:
1. Casdoor can be logged in and used normally.
2. Set Casdoor's `origin` value (conf/app.conf) to `CASDOOR_HOSTNAME`.

## Step2. Configure Casdoor application
1. Create or use an existing Casdoor application.
2. Add a redirect url: `http://APISIX_HOSTNAME/REDIRECTWHATYOUWANT`,and change `REDIRECTWHATYOUWANT` to the redirect url you need.
3. Select "JWT-Empty" for the Token format option
4. Add provider you want and supplement other settings.

Not surprisingly, you can get two values ​​on the application settings page: `Client ID` and `Client secret` like the picture above, we will use them in next step.

Open your favorite browser and visit: **http://`CASDOOR_HOSTNAME`/.well-known/openid-configuration**, you will see the OIDC configure of Casdoor.

## Step3. Configure APISIX
APISIX has official [OIDC](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/openid-connect/) support, which is implemented using [lua-resty-openidc](https://github.com/zmartzone/lua-resty-openidc).

You can customize the settings according to the APISIX OIDC documentation, in which the following routing settings will be used:

```bash
#Use your own X-Api-Key
$ curl  -XPOST APISIX_HOSTNAME/apisix/admin/routes -H "X-Api-Key: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1" -d '{
  "uri": "/get",
  "name": "apisix_casdoor_test",
  "plugins": {
    "openid-connect": {
      "client_id": "Client ID",
      "client_secret": "Client secret",
      "discovery": "http://CASDOOR_HOSTNAME/.well-known/openid-configuration",
      "introspection_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_basic",
      "logout_path": "/logout",
      "realm": "master",
      "redirect_uri": "http://APISIX_HOSTNAME/REDIRECTWHATYOUWANT",
      "bearer_only": false,
      "set_id_token_header": false,
      "access_token_in_authorization_header": true,
      "set_access_token_header": true,
      "set_userinfo_header": false,
      "realm": "master"
    }
  },
  "upstream": {
    "type": "roundrobin",
    "nodes": {
      "httpbin.org:80": 1
    }
  }
}'
```
Now, visit `http://APISIX_HOSTNAME/get`, the browser will redirect you to the casdoor login page, and after successfully logging in, you will, not surprisingly, see that we have sent a request to httpbin.org.
